<h1>Syllabus</h1>

<p>This course covers Internet application programming, including
client-server and web applications. At the end of this course,
students should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the BSD socket API to develop network applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand and use concurrent programming to develop a thread-safe
server, including both thread pool and event-driven architectures.</p></li>
<li><p>Use experiments to conduct an in-depth performance evaluation of
network software to better understand design tradeoffs and operating
system overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a common web application framework to build a web database
application, using either a relational or no-SQL database.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand security issues for network software and be able to write
code that is secure against common attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the confidence and ability to quickly learn a new language and
libraries.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Textbooks and Online Resources</h2>

<p>You do not need to buy a textbook for this class. Instead, you should
be able to learn everything from lecture notes and online
materials.</p>

<p>We will use the languages that are most popular for networking: C/C++,
Python, and Javascript. The course is designed to require you to
quickly adapt to a new language and conventions, using available
online materials, much like computer scientists do in practice. You
should be ready for this and plan ahead as appropriate.</p>

<p>Below are some sources I use for the material in this class:</p>

<h3>Socket Programming</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook/dp/1593272200/">The Linux Programming Interface</a></p>

<p>A great book that explains everything you need to know about
programming with the Linux operating system. This includes file
I/O, threads, sockets, signals, and much more.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unix-Network-Programming-Volume-Networking/dp/0131411551">Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Network API, 3rd Edition</a></p>

<p>This has been the definitive reference for network programming for
more than a decade, and has been recently updated. In addition to
sockets, this book covers threads, concurrent architectures, and
many network programming details.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>C/C++ Programming</h3>

<p>We will use C/C++ for some labs, so it will be helpful to have a good
reference.  I strongly recommend using an online tutorial or buying
a book if you are not confident in your C/C++ coding.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.learncpp.com/">LearnCpp</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113/">C++ Primer</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321958314/">A Tour of C++</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>We will use Python for some labs and for processing and graphing data.
I list some free online references below, plus a book in case you want
one.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python">Codecademy Python course</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.learnpython.org/">Learn Python Interactive Tutorial</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Edition-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730/">Learning Python, 5th Edition</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I also suggest that you become familiar with the official <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/">Python documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Javascript</h3>

<p>We will use Javascript to write a web application, with
<a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> on
the back end, and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> on the
front end.</p>

<p>To learn HTML and CSS, see:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Codecademy HTML and CSS Tutorial</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/">CSS Tutorial</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://learnlayout.com/">Learn CSS Layout</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>To learn Javascript, use some of the following resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript">Codecademy Javascript course</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Kahn Academy Javascript course</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Computing Environment</h2>

<p>We will be using a Linux environment for this class. You can use the
Linux labs, use a live USB to boot into Linux, or setup a virtual
machine running Linux. We will be using Python 2.7, along with various
packages such as matplotlib and LaTeX.  You are strongly encouraged to
become familiar with Linux, its software, and the command-line
environment. Being fluent in multiple computing environments is an
important part of a CS education.</p>

<p>You may, if you are talented and persistent, figure out how to setup a
MacOS machine with the required software. I cannot provide help with
this, and your code will be expected to run on a Linux machine when
you submit it. There are a number of areas, particularly for
synchronization, where the libraries are different for MacOS and
Linux. Be sure to test your code in a Linux environment.</p>

<h2>Code Editor</h2>

<p>I personally use emacs and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>, and
I know many others use vim. You may also want to check out
<a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> and <a href="http://brackets.io/">Atom</a>. I
highly recommend a code editor and <em>not</em> an IDE, so that you learn
to compile and run code using the command line. This will come in handy
when you need to do remote system administration.</p>

<h2>Source Control</h2>

<p>Regardless of the computing environment you use, you should become
familiar with <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Git</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You should store your code in a <em>private</em> Git
repository. <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> provides free private
repositories.</p>

<h2>Assignments and Grading Policy</h2>

<p>Attendance and participation in class is expected.</p>

<p>The assignments for this class will consist of homework, labs and
exams.  Homework will involve short assignments that will be checked
in class. Grading will be based on a self-assessment of pass/fail.
<strong>Participation is required for these sessions.</strong></p>

<p>Labs must be written in the assigned language and must compile and run
on the department&#39;s Linux machines.  Labs will be graded by the TA or
instructor.  For some labs, the scoring will be based on running your
code.  In these cases, we will publish a grading sheet before each
assignment is due, listing the tests we will run and how many points
each test is worth. Each student will run test cases for themselves
and for two othre students, roughly one week after each lab is
due. This will give you an opportunity to see how someone else&#39;s code
works and to learn from how they have written their code. Scores will
be assigned by the instructor, taking into account test cases as well
as a short lab report.</p>

<p>Grading for exams will be on a scale of 0 to 10 for each problem, with
a final score based on the total possible points.  A score of 10
indicates your answer is completely correct (A), and a score of 5
indicates your answer is entirely wrong but you made a reasonable
effort (E).  Grades in between indicate very good (9), good (8),
adequate (7), and poor (6). Failure to make a reasonable effort to
answer a question scores a 0.</p>

<p>Your final grade will be computed by weighting all scores as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Homework 10%</p>

<p>Labs 60%</p>

<p>Exams 30%</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Late Policy</h2>

<p>Labs are due on the day indicated. To accommodate difficulties in your
schedule, you can turn in work late, but you will be penalized 10% for
every 2 days, up to a maximum of 30% off. No late work will be
accepted after 6 days. Weekends and holidays are counted. No late work
can be turned in after the last day of classes.</p>

<p>You may avoid late penalties due to a medical excuse by making an
arrangement in advance with the instructor. I will also happily make
exceptions for those with a documented disability.</p>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>Most assignments for this class must be done individually. You are,
however, strongly encouraged to discuss solving the homeworks, labs
and any programming problems you encounter generally. The primary
requirement is that you must write your own code and should not view
any other student&#39;s code.  When producing written work, your writing
must be your own thoughts.  Your use of sources (ideas, quotations,
paraphrases) must be properly acknowledged and documented.</p>

<p>Group work is permitted only where specified clearly in the
assignment.  Group work is meant to be done jointly with a team of two
to five students.  Students in a group should work on problems and
programs together, and each student should perform a roughly equal
amount of work.</p>

<h2>Educational Policies</h2>

<h3>Honor Code Standards</h3>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the <a href="http://honorcode.byu.edu/">BYU Honor
Code</a>, students are expected to be honest
in all of their academic work.  Academic honesty means, most
fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be
your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle
may result in a failing grade in the course and additional
disciplinary action by the university.</p>

<h3>Policy on Harassment</h3>

<p>Harassment of any kind is inappropriate at BYU. Specifically, BYU&#39;s
policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employees of the
university but to students as well. If you encounter sexual
harassment, gender-based discrimination, or other inappropriate
behavior, please talk to your professor, contact the Equal Employment
Office at 422-5895 or 367-5689, or contact the Honor Code Office at
422-2847.</p>

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

<p>BYU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to qualified
persons with disabilities. If you have any disability that may
adversely affect your success in this course, please contact the
University Accessibility Center at 422-2767. Services deemed
appropriate will be coordinated with the student and instructor by
that office.</p>
